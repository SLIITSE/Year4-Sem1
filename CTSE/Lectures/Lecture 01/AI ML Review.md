## What is Deep Learning ?

Deep Learning & Machine Learning is part of the Narrow AI

## What is AI ? 

Wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## What is ML ?

A scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

## Unsupervised Learning
Perform a prediction or classification using unlabeled data

## Supervised Learning
Is a class of machine learning in a which model is trained using a set of pre existing data set
- ### Linear Regression
- Predicting a continuous value based on observations features
