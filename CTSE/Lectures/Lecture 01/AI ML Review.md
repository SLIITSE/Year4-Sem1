# AI ML

## What is Deep Learning ?

Deep Learning & Machine Learning is part of the Narrow AI

## What is AI ? 

Wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## What is ML ?

A scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

## The difference between AI and ML ðŸ¤”

| AI  | ML |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Application of AI that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. | The development of automated computer programs which requires human interaction. |

## (01)Unsupervised Learning
Perform a prediction or classification using unlabeled data

- ### K-Means Clustering<br>

- ### Principal Component Analysis
**PCA** is to use to find lower dimensional representation of data that retain much information as possible

- ### Decision Trees

## (02)Supervised Learning
Is a class of machine learning in a which model is trained using a set of pre existing data set
- ### Linear Regression
Predicting a continuous value based on observations features

- ### Quantile Regression
Helps to predict the range or entire distribution of the target variable

- ### Logistic Regression ( Classification )
Predicting qualitative values based on observations features

## (03)Semi - Supervised Learning
used both labelled and ulabelled data

## (04)Reinforcement Learning
