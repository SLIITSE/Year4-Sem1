# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,
applications, and services)

Working models for cloud computing:ðŸ™„

- Service
- Deployment

### Advantages

- It can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort
- It provides high level abstraction of computation and storage model
- It has some essential characteristics, service models, and deployment models.

# Service Model 

### Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)

- The capability provided to the consumer is to use the providerâ€™s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

- The applications are accessible from various client devices such as a web browser

Examples: Caspio, Google Apps, Salesforce, Nivio, Learn.com.

### Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS):

The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools
supported by the provider.

Examples: Windows Azure, Google App Engine.

### Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources.

Examples: Amazon EC2, Go-Grid, Rackspace Cloud Servers, Relia Cloud.

## Deployment Models

Deployment models define the type of access to the cloud, i.e., how the cloud is located? Cloud can have any of the four types of access: Public, Private, Hybrid and
Community.

Private Cloud:

The cloud is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.

Community Cloud:

The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific    community that has shared concerns.
